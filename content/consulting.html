I've spent the majority of the past decade working as a consultant and agency guy. At firms both large (10,000+) and small (3) I've worked with some of the biggest companies in the world on a wide range of projects. I've worked on humble one page to multi-million dollar CMS implementations and everything in between. Along the way I'd like to think I've learned a thing or two about a thing or two. 

While I currently am employed full-time I am available for certain types of consulting- mostly surrounding DevOps, Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) issues and hard technical challenges in JavaScript, TypeScript of SVG.  and <p>Visit <a href="http://palatinoconsutling.com/" title="my consutling company" rel="me">Palatino Consulting, LLC</a> to learn more. </p>
